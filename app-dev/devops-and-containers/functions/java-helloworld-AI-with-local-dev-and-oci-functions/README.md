# A Java AI featured function with local dev and then building and deploying to OCI Functions

Reviewed: 31.10.2024
 
# When to use this asset?
 
Anyone who wants to develop OCI GenAI capable Functions and this example shows how I'm doing this locally using Fn (<a href="https://fnproject.io">https://fnproject.io</a>) on my mac with Apple silicon that uses mainly ARM architecture and then building and then deploying the same to Functions in OCI.

# Author
<a href="https://github.com/mikarinneoracle">mikarinneoracle</a>

# How to use this asset?

This example is based on the <a href="../java-helloworld-with-local-dev-and-oci-functions">java-helloworld-with-local-dev-and-oci-functions</a> and hence building and deploying is exactly the same but this time uses <code>OCI SDK</code> and <code>OCI Generative AI services</code> to produce the function output instead of just a simple "Hello World".

<p>

To do the OCI SDK authentication and authorization to use the GenAI services the function uses two options:
<ul>
<li><b>IAM regular user</b> for the local dev and test on mac</li>
<li><b>InstancePrincipal</b> for the OCI Function by passing config key <code>AUTH_INSTANCE_PRINCIPAL</code> with any value (then not being null)</li>
</ul>

<p>
IAM user option will work on both cases above, as local and as OCI Function.

## Build and test

During following the steps of the <a href="../java-helloworld-with-local-dev-and-oci-functions">Hello function example </a> adjust the <a href="https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/main/app-dev/devops-and-containers/functions/java-helloworld-AI-with-local-dev-and-oci-functions/files/src/main/java/com/example/HelloAIFunction.java#L93">line 93</a> to match your <code>GenAI service OCID</code>.
