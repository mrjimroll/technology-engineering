# VPN IPSEC Assets

VPN IPSec Reusable Asset provides a secure and reliable virtual private network (VPN) solution within Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). It enables organizations to establish encrypted connections between their on-premises networks and OCI, ensuring secure data transmission and communication.

Key Features:

- Secure Communication: Create a private and encrypted connection between your on-premises network and OCI using the IPSec VPN protocol. This ensures that data transmitted over the VPN is protected from unauthorized access and eavesdropping.
- Flexible Configuration: Configure the VPN IPSec tunnels to meet your specific network requirements, including tunnel modes, encryption algorithms, authentication methods, and key exchange protocols. Customize the configuration to align with your security policies and compliance needs.
- Site-to-Site Connectivity: Establish a site-to-site VPN connection, allowing seamless and secure communication between your on-premises network and your virtual cloud network (VCN) in OCI. This enables you to extend your on-premises network to OCI, facilitating hybrid cloud architectures.
