# AHF Reports - Customer Guide

**NOTE**: Before generating the AHF reports it is important to install the latest version of the AHF suite.

## Update AHF

The main MOS note for the AHF maintenance is: 

*Autonomous Health Framework (AHF) - Including Trace File Analyzer and Orachk/Exachk (Doc ID 2550798.1)*

**How-To update the AHF software**

* Download the up-to-date AHF software from the MOS Note (*2550798.1*)

* Stage the latest Autonomous Health Framework source file to a temporary directory and unzip it.

        cd /stage/directory
        unzip AHF-LINUX_<version>.zip 

* Execute the following setup command, from the location in which Autonomous Health Framework is staged: 
  
        ./ahf_setup -ahf_loc /opt -data_dir /u02 -local

### Get Latest CVU

It can be required to install the latest Cluster Verification Utility (CVU) utility to allow the exachk to complete the cluvfy checks.

Usualy, running the *_exachk_*, if the CVU update is required, this is the prompt the appears before starting the checks:


    Either Cluster Verification Utility pack (cvupack) does not exist at /opt/oracle.ahf/common/cvu or it is an old or invalid cvupack

    Checking Cluster Verification Utility (CVU) version at CRS Home - /u01/app/19.0.0.0/grid

    This version of Cluster Verification Utility (CVU) was released on 26-Dec-2023 and it is older than 180 days. It is highly recommended that you download the latest version of CVU from MOS patch 30839369 to ensure the highest level of accuracy of the data contained within the report

    Do you want to download latest version of Cluster Verification Utility (CVU) from my oracle support? [y/n] [y]


You can download the zip when prompted, if the VM has internet access and you have MOS account. 
Otherwise you should download the lates CVU version from MOS, sarching patch 30839369. When you have downloaded the zip version of the latest CVU, unzip it into /opt/oracle.ahf/common/cvu and run the *_exachk_*

## Execute AHF Compliance Report

To generate the AHF Compliance Report, please, follow the below instructions.

**NOTE**: run _ahfctl_ root user.

    $ sudo su - root
