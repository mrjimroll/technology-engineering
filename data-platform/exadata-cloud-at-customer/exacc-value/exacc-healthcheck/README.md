# Exadata Cloud@Customer - Health Check

## Introduction

The Health Check is an assessment that can be requested by the Customers to review the ExaDB-C@C deployments.

The main reasons that may motivate the request of an ExaDB-C@C Health Check are: 

* Check ExaDB-C@C deployment best-practices application, to verify any drift in the configurations that may lead to unexpected behaviours.
* Verify if the implemented Architecture matches with the requirements defined by the customer during the solution definition. Each solution has its own requirements in terms of High Availability, SLAs, Backup Policies, Patching Policies, and Disaster Recovery. Verifying that the running services match all the prerequisites, help in the definition of a robust and well-defined solution, reducing the risks to expose the customer to unexpected issues that are often caused by misconfigured systems are all amongst the objectives. 
* Assess the infrastructure after experiencing any unexpected behavior. Even if the Health Check is not a reactive measure, getting the possibility to assess the entire infrastructure after the immediate resolution of disruptive events, may help in preventing further faults: a critical issue can be the consequence of misconfigured systems, where identifying any discrepancies at an early stage from the best practices will help in avoiding escalations for certain situations. 

## Goals 

The goals of the Health Check are the following: 

* Verify the architecture, identify any logical discrepancies between the requirements and the defined configurations
* Verify the ExaDB-C@C configurations, identify any issues that may be caused by non compliant systems
* Offer the customer the possibility to get a consolidated report of the health of its overall infrastructure

## How-To

To request the ExaDB-C@C Health Check, Please reach out to your Oracle Account Team.

The assessment will be led by the EMEA Exadata Cloud@Customer Specialist Team. 

To proceed with the analysis, the initiator will be asked to provide:
* Compiling detailed information to a questionnaire on the overall deployment
* Architecture References, documenting the solution requirements and the implemented configuration
* Compliance Reports & Configuration Details

Once the Health Check is completed, the initiator will receive a commprehensive report detailing all findings of the analysis.
