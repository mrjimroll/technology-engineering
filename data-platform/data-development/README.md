Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL allows you to perform a variety of operations such as querying data, updating records, creating and modifying schema, and controlling access to the database. It is a crucial skill for data developers and analysts, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation to support data-driven decision-making.
PL/SQL, the Oracle procedural extension of SQL, is a portable, high-performance transaction-processing language. PL/SQL offers several advantages over other programming languages: from being tightly integrated with SQL to leveraging High Performance and High Productivity. PL/SQL is a portable and scalable Procedural Language which also increase Manageability and support for Object Oriented Programming.
