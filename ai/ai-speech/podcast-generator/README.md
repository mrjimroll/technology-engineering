# Podcast generator using OCI Generative AI, Oracle Speech & Visual Builder

Welcome to this guide on building a groundbreaking application that uses Oracle's AI-powered tools to generate high-quality podcasts effortlessly. Leveraging the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GenAI and AI Speech (Text-to-Speech) services, this solution transforms written content into engaging, natural-sounding audio.
The application is designed to streamline podcast production through advanced AI capabilities. Starting from a simple text input, the app uses GenAI to generate a structured podcast script. It then enhances the speech output with SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language), which gives the audio a natural flow, making it sound like a professional recording. The result is a high-quality audio experience that can cater to a wide range of content needs and audiences.
This application is built using Oracle Visual Builder Cloud Service (VBCS), a powerful low-code platform that simplifies development and accelerates the creation of robust applications without extensive coding. With this low-code approach, even complex workflows are straightforward to set up, allowing developers to focus on leveraging AI's potential for high-quality audio synthesis.
This AI-powered solution not only automates and optimizes the podcast creation process but also allows content creators to deliver professional audio content at scale efficiently.
