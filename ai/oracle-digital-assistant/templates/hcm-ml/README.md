# When to use this asset?

Background
  Oracle Digital Assistant is an environment for building digital assistants, which are user interfaces driven by artificial intelligence (AI) that help users accomplish a variety of tasks in natural language conversations. Digital assistants consist of one or more skills, which are individual chatbots that are focused on specific types of tasks.
  In this lab, you will create a Multilingual HCM bot with Q&A based on the HCM_ML template. This bot will be able to:
    1. Answer questions based on the users data in Oracle Fusion HCM
    2. Answer generic questions (Q&A)

Scope
  The HCM_ML template contains a subset of the HCM SaaS skill as a starting point:
    1. Absence balance
    2. Find co-worker details
    3. Payslip information
  See the HCM Skill Documentation Excel sheet (in zipfile) with all intents and the ones (high) already created Arabic translations for as an example.
